Tasks to be done by each team member  -->
                                        To analyze existing code in MultisequenceLearning.cs & the method RunMultiSequenceLearningExperiment.
                                        To learn how sequence learning and prediction works.
                                        Play around with the ML.NET library and get familiar.

Added new method for testing sequence.
