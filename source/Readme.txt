Topic : Prediction of multisequence learning

Analyzing the existing project and method

Currently work on -
Understanding the exsiting methods present in MultiSequenceLearning,
how multiple sequences can be learned and illustrates how prediction works by using the experimental class Predictor and how anomaly detection can be implemented by using neocortexapi.
